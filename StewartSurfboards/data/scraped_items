The Funline 11 paddles really big, rides really small. It\u2019s designed to easily catch waves in all conditions, for surfers from beginners to advanced. A mini version of our best-selling Redline 11 longboard, the Funline is super wide in the front for paddle power. It has a flat straight entry rocker with flip in the tip. An extra long concave in the nose, for trim speed and paddling, that\u2019s perfectly blended into double concave V in the tail for speed and quick rail exchange. Bill invented the beveled rail over 30 years ago, and it remains a key feature in many of his board designs for a reason. The bevels in the nose rails lift the rail edge making them really forgiving on the drop-in and in rail to rail turns. The hard edges in the tails rail release water for insane speed. <br><br>Fins included! Boards under 7'6 - Futures composite thruster fin set.
